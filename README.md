### What are Data Structures?
* Data structure is a storage that is used to store and organize data. It is a way of arranging data on a computer so that it can be accessed and updated efficiently.

***
### Types of Data Structure:

* Linear data structure
* Non-linear data structure

***
### Why should one learn data structures and algorithms ?

* Building Block for our Career.
* Essential skill for job in Software Development.

## Advantages of Data Structures:

* Efficiency: If the choice of a data structure for implementing a particular ADT is proper, it makes the program very efficient in terms of time and space.

* Reusability: The data structure provides reusability means that multiple client programs can use the data structure.

* Abstraction: The data structure specified by an ADT also provides the level of abstraction. The client cannot see the internal working of the data structure, so it does not have to worry about the implementation part. The client can only see the interface.
